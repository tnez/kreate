> Minimize friction when starting a new project

This is a **no-friction** way for me to start a new project the way I like it. This will create a new project directory and set it up the way I like it based on the project type.

This was built for my own personal use, so **YMMV**, but _more power to ya_ if anyone else finds some utility here.

## How it works

Create a new project with the specified type.

```bash
npx @tnez/kreate --type www <new-project-name>
```

```bash
npx @tnez/kreate --type api <new-project-name>
```

```bash
npx @tnez/kreate --type lib <new-project-name>
```
